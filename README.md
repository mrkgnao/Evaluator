#A math evaluator in Haskell
This evaluator can evaluate math expressions like exp(2) + sin(3) + 4^5. The speciality of this program is that it supports complex numbers.

The Complex module has a lot of extra functions so that it can be used for other purposes.

I wrote this to learn Haskell and the hallowed Shunting Yard algorithm. Since that was my main goal, I didn't include too many functions, but they can be easily added.

Supported Functions: exp, ln, sqrt, sin, cos, tan  
Supported Operators: +,-,*,/,^

For a full-blown evaluator, check out my Expression repository (it is written in Java though).
